## Evaluation Questions

Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability to show your understanding of the learning outcomes. Please provide examples from your project code to support your answers.


## Evaluation Material


### Q1. Algorithms

Algorithms are manyfold and Java can be used to program these. Examples are sorting or search strategies but also mathematical calculations. Please refer to **two** areas in either your regular coding practice (for example from Semester 1) or within your project, where you have coded an algorithm. Do not make reference to code written for other classes, like theoretical informatics.


*during the first semester I was testing differents sorting algorithms in Java, along with Hash Map usage
Here you can see the discusion: https://github.com/bermar24/Programming_DHBW_24/discussions/7
An example of HashMap: https://github.com/bermar24/Programming_DHBW_24/blob/main/HashAndSort/hashMap.java
An example of QuickSort: https://github.com/bermar24/Programming_DHBW_24/blob/main/HashAndSort/quickSort.java

### Q2. Data types

Please explain the concept of data types and provide examples of different data types in Java.
typical data types in java are int, double, float, char, boolean, long, short, byte, String, and arrays. Please provide one example for each of the **four** following data types in your code.
* arrays
* Strings
* boolean
* your choice


*Typical data types in Java define the kind of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. Java divides data types into two categories:

- **Primitive types**: basic building blocks (e.g., int, boolean, double).
- **Reference types**: objects that refer to instances of classes (e.g., String, arrays, custom classes).

* arrays
  https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/Plant.java
27     private List<CareEvent> careHistory;
* Strings
  https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/Plant.java
21  private String name;

* boolean
  https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/Plant.java
42 public boolean needsWatering() {...}


* double
  https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/WateringEvent.java
12     private double amountLiters;

### Q3. Complex Data Structures

Examples of complex data structures in java are ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, and TreeMap. Please provide an example of how you have used **two** of these complex data structures in your code and explain why you have chosen these data structures.

*ArrayList: Chosen because I expect to add multiples CareHistory entries for each plant, allowing dynamic resizing and easy iteration.
   37   this.careHistory = new ArrayList<>();
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/TransplantEvent.java
HashSet: Chosen to store unique collaborator IDs for shared plant lists, ensuring no duplicates and efficient membership checks.
    34    this.collaboratorIds = new HashSet<>();
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/PlantList.java

### Q4. Concepts of OOP
Concepts of OOP are the basic building blocks of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, methods, and attributes. 
Explain HOW and WHY your **project** demonstrates the use of OOP by using all of the following concepts:
* Classes/Objects
* Methods
* Attributes 
Link to the code in your project that demonstrates what you have explained above.

*In my project, I demonstrate OOP concepts through:
Each plant is object of the Plant class.
The class Plant is a blueprint thet defines atributes (variables) and methods (functions). Describing the behavior and state of the object Plant:


https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/Plant.java
18 public class Plant {
20     private String id;    This is an atribut
42     public boolean needsWatering() { this is a method
43     return schedule != null && schedule.needsWatering(); }  != is an operator
46     public void addCareEvent(CareEvent event) { ...} this is a metod

|             6           |                               |

### Q5. OO Design
Please showcase **two** areas where you have used object orientation and explain the advantage that object oriented code brings to the application or the problem that your code is addressing.
Examples in java of good oo design are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 


*
Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of how an object works and only exposing what is necessary through a public interface.

        Key Goals of Encapsulation:
                      - Protect internal data from being directly accessed or changed.
                      - Control how data is accessed or modified.
                      - Make code easier to maintain and debug.
                      - Improve modularity â€” objects manage their own data.

https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/PlantList.java
26  private List<String> plantIds;                        Private fields (hidden from outside)
35     this.plantIds = new ArrayList<>();                 Constructor
54 -60      public void addPlant(String plantId) {        Public method to access the value
            ...  plantIds.add(plantId); ... }


Inheritance allows a class to acquire the atributes and methods of another class.
        - Code Reusability â€“ Common logic can be written once in a superclass.
        -Hierarchy â€“ Helps organize related classes in a natural structure.
        -Extensibility â€“ You can add or override behavior in the subclass.
    
    // Superclass
    15 public abstract class CareEvent {...}
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/CareEvent.java

    // Subclass
    public class WateringEvent extends CareEvent { ...}
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/WateringEvent.java
    public class TransplantEvent extends CareEvent {...}
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/TransplantEvent.java
    public class FertilizingEvent extends CareEvent {...}
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/FertilizingEvent.java

### Q6. Testing
Java code is tested by using JUnit. Please explain how you have used JUnit in your project and provide a link to the code where you have used JUnit. Links do not have to refer to your project and can refer to your practice code. If you tested without JUnit, please explain how you tested your code.
Be detailed about what you are testing and how you argue for your test cases. 

Feel free to refer to the vibe coding session where you explored testing. (pair programming - you may link to your partner git and name him/her.)

Test cases usually cover the following areas:
* boundary cases
* normal cases
* error cases / catching exceptions

### Q7. Operator/Method Overloading
An example of operator overloading is the "+" operator that can be used to add two numbers or concatenate two strings. An example of method overloading is having two methods with the same name but different parameters. Please provide an example of how you have used operator or method overloading in your code and explain why you have chosen this method of coding.
The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.

|          6              |                               |



### Q8. Templates/Generics
Generics in java are used to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of specified types. Please provide an example of how you have used generics in your code and explain why you have chosen to use generics. The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.

*
Generics allow you to write classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with any data type, while maintaining type safety.
23  private Set<String> tags;
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/Plant.java

Generics + Polymorphism
27   private List<CareEvent> careHistory;  \\ CareEvent is the base superclass with subclasses.
It combines generics and polymorphism by saying: "Give me a list of anything that is-an CareEvent."
https://github.com/bermar24/IstDurstig/blob/main/backend/src/main/java/istdurstig/model/Plant.java

|           6             |                               |

### Q9. Class Libraries
Examples of class libraries in java are the Java Standard Library, JavaFX, Apache Commons, JUnit, Log4j, Jackson, Guava, Joda-Time, Hibernate, Spring, Maven, and many more. Please provide an example of how you have used a class library in your **project** code and explain why you have chosen to use this class library. 

* 
    Using class libraries helps you follow OOP principles like:
        -Reusability: You donâ€™t reinvent the wheel.
        -Encapsulation: Internal details of how a class works are hidden.
        -Abstraction: You use the what, not the how.
    These libraries are built using OOP best practices and encourage modular, clean, and maintainable code.

3-12    ...
        import java.time.LocalDateTime;
        import java.util.ArrayList;
        import java.util.List;
        import java.util.Set;
